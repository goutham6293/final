# My News Site

This folder contains a simple example website inspired by [Eenadu](https://www.eenadu.net/). It includes a homepage with a header, navigation menu, a section for top news articles, and a footer. The code is intentionally minimal to serve as a starting point for your own project.

## Structure

- `index.html` – The main HTML file that defines the layout.
- `style.css` – Basic styling for the site.
- `script.js` – A small JavaScript file that can be expanded for interactivity.

To view the page, open `index.html` in a web browser.
